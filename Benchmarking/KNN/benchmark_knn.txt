//============================================================================

The following measurements were taken by running the benchmarking methods on Google Cloud. 

The following times are smaller than those presented in the coreesponding benchmark_knn.cpp file as the author's computer is etremely slow.

The first two tests compared CliqueLib's Armadillo vs. 'vector<vector> >' implementations. 

As you can see, Armadillo greatly increased the performance of the library.

CliqueLib Armadillo:

Runtime: 26149 microseconds

CliqueLib Vectors:

Runtime: 201631 microseconds.

Consequently, the performance was compared with Java's Weka machine learning library and C++'s Mlpack library. Our Armadillo implementation performed very well and even beat Mlpack.

Weka:

Benchmark Weka: KNN

=== Classifier model (full training set) ===

IB1 instance-based classifier
using 23 nearest neighbour(s) for classification

Runtime: 0.03 Seconds ~ 30000 microseconds

Mlpack:

Runtime: 27743 microseconds
